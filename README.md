# Welcome to the Programming Club Portfolio Project!

Hello team! ðŸŽ‰

Weâ€™re excited to build something amazing together. This project will be a showcase of our club's skills and creativity, and with everyone's contribution, itâ€™s going to be a project weâ€™ll all be proud of. Below are some important guidelines to help keep us on track and maintain a high-quality codebase.

## Important Notes:

1. **WebP Format for Media**:  
   All images, videos, and other media should be in **WebP** format to ensure **best performance and compatibility** across browsers, for Icons or logos SVG should do the trick.  

2. **Branching and Pull Requests**:  
   - **Never commit directly to the `main` branch**.  
   - Create a new branch with the name of the feature or page you are working on.  
   - Once done, create a pull request and provide a **clear description** and, if possible, **screenshots** of your work.
   - **Collaborate on Pull Requests**: Everyone should review, give feedback, and suggest improvements to maintain high standards. Donâ€™t hesitate to be a critic or submit your approval! ðŸ‘¥

3. **Minimize Dependencies**:  
   The fewer external packages we use, the better! If something can be done **without adding extra packages**, letâ€™s create it ourselves to keep our project light and maintainable. ðŸ’¡

4. **Icons**:  
   For consistency, we will use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) throughout the project. Theyâ€™re easy to use, lightweight, and customizable.

5. **Design**:  
   Weâ€™re aiming to match **80-90%** of the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/cgLQEj3pSoexlvSJJuADxI/Programming-Club-Project1?node-id=2-7&node-type=rounded_rectangle&m=dev) as closely as possible. Clean and precise design implementation is key to making our portfolio stand out! ðŸŽ¨

6. **Clean and Readable Code**:  
   Maintain **clear, organized, and readable code**. This helps everyone understand the project better and makes it easier to collaborate and contribute. Proper formatting, comments where needed, and consistency are a must.

7. **Team Collaboration on Pull Requests**:  
   Once a pull request is submitted, **everyone on the team** should review it. Provide feedback, suggest improvements, and share your thoughts. **Teamwork makes the dream work!** ðŸŒŸ

## Final Notes:
- All **colors, formatting, and initial setup** have been configured already. Stick to these for consistency.
- Keep the **spirit of learning and collaboration** alive. Weâ€™re all here to improve and grow, so letâ€™s encourage and help each other along the way.

Together, letâ€™s create something awesome! ðŸ’»ðŸŽ‰
